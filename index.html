  Hi, I’m Joe Rollman. I’m always searching for and working on projects that make people’s lives better.

  Right now, I’m spending time learning about the AI ecosystem and I plan on creating multi-agentic programs in the near future.

Outside of studying and working, I enjoy meeting new people, traveling, and reading.

If you’re interested in learning more about me, please check out my “Blog” page where I write about things I’ve learned or found interesting.

The “Resources” page is where you’ll find a list of external resources that I found particularly insightful.

To reach out to me directly, please check out the  “Contact Us” page.
